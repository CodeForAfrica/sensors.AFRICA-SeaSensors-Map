# sensors.AFRICA SeaSensors-Map

Sea Sensors is an acoustic data project that falls under the [sensors.AFRICA](https://sensors.africa) umbrella.

The project uses hydrophone sensors submerged underwater at locations off Tanzaniaâ€™s coast that record underwater sounds,
including dynamite blasts, and is expected to record this information over the course of an entire year.
The sensors.AFRICA-SeaSensors-map project is expected to present this data in a visually appealing interactive map.

Our primary goal of the map is to:

1. Show physical locations(geolocation) of the sensors deployed on the map.
2. Shows the geographic locations of blast where availble , and where not available, showcase the bearing to the blast (as lines originating from the detector).
3. Show a counter that gives a summary of the blast detected according to time, day, today state etc
4. Allow users to view a timeseries of the data and to play, pause or toggle sounds of the explosions.
