# sensors.AFRICA SeaSensors-Map

Sea Sensors is an acoustic data project that falls under the sensors.AFRICA umbrella.

The project uses hydrophone sensors submerged underwater at locations off Tanzaniaâ€™s coast that record underwater sounds,
including dynamite blasts, and is expected to record this information over the course of an entire year.sensors.AFRICA SeaSensors-map project is expected to present this data in a visually appealing interactive map
Our primary goal is to be able to have a map that:

1. Shows the geographic locations of blast where availble , and where not available, showcase the bearing to the blast (as lines originating from the detector.
2. Show blast locations to be color coded and filtered according to month, season, time of day (morning, afternoon, night), tidal state etc
3. Generate graphs of number of blasts detected according to different criteria: (month, period of day, tidal state etc)
4. Allow users to play sounds of the explosions with a play button
